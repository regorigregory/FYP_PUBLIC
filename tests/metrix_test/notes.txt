Non-occluded regions (white) and occluded and border regions (black).
Errors are only evaluated in the white regions.

Regions near depth discontinuities1 (white), occluded and border regions (black), and other regions (gray).
Errors are only evaluated in the white regions.

(1) The definition of these regions is different from the old version (we now consider neighborhoods of depth discontinuities AND half-occluded regions), resulting in slighly different error statistics.

Error bars in the stereo evaluation table
(new feature, added June 22 2008)

Motivation and explanation:
---------------------------

The error bars give a visual indication of how well the methods
perform.  They show the average percentage of bad pixels over all
twelve columns (or, if one of the sorting buttons is clicked, of
the selected (green) columns).  Note that this is *not* the metric
by which the table is sorted, which is the average *rank* over all
(selected) columns.

The main reason that we visualize a different metric than the sorting
metric is that generally too much importance is given to the exact
rank of a method in the table.  For example, it is fairly arbitrary
which method is currently ranked #1 among the top 3 or 4 methods,
especially since we cannot control the amount of parameter tuning that
different authors do.  While the average rank provides a reasonable
way of ordering the methods, the average error visualized by the error
bars shows just how close the top-performing methods are to each
other, and thus (hopefully) deemphasizes the exact position in the
table.

The length of each error bar is proportional to the error, from 0 to
the maximal error in the table.


Many thanks to Heiko Hirschmueller for suggesting this feature and to
David Fouhey for implementing it.
